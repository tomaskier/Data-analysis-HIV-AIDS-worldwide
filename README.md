Analysis of a dataset taken from World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids). I developed an exploratory and predictive analysis taken into acount ARV (antirretroviral) coverage per countries, number od deaths caused by AIDS and number of people living with HIV (notifications - deaths). Some insights: 1) Deaths caused by AIDS per year will still be an issue in 2030. 2) 45% of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and 52% of children with HIV do not total coverage of ARV nowadays 3) There is a strong correlation between the increment of ARV among PLHIV and among children. 4) Africa is still the continent with more new cases and deaths caused by AIDS.
