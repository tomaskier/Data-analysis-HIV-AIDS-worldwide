While there have been significant drugs and treatments improvements, we still have to think about how to tackle aids. Some of the reasons why:

1) Deaths caused by AIDS per year will still be an issue in 2030.
2) 45% of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and 52% of children with HIV do not have full coverage of ARV nowadays
3) There is a strong correlation between the increment of ARV among PLHIV and among children.
4) Africa is still the continent with more new cases and deaths caused by AIDS.

This Analysis was taken from base data published by World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and Our World in Data (https://lnkd.in/dZnpXAww). I developed an exploratory and predictive analysis taken into account antirretroviral coverage per countries, number of deaths caused by AIDS and number of people living with HIV (notifications â€“ deaths).
