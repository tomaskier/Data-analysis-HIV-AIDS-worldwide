Data analysis of dataset taken from World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids). I developed an exploratory and predictive analysis taken into acount ARV coverage per countries, number od deaths caused by AIDS and number of people living with HIV. Results ilustrate: 1) Hardly will UNAIDSÂ´s 2030 target be achieved due to the fact that people will still die by AIDS. 2) 45% of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and 52% of children with HIV do not recieve ARV 3) There is a strong correlation between the increment of ARV among PLHIV and for children.
